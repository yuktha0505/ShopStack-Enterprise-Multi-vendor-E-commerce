Payment information includes:

Razorpay Order ID
Razorpay Payment ID
Razorpay Signature
Payment status
Payment method

Sensitive Razorpay credentials must be stored using environment variables or secure configuration and must never be committed to the repository.

🔐 Authentication & Authorization

ShopStack uses JWT-based authentication with role-based authorization.

Authentication

Users authenticate using their registered credentials.

After successful authentication, the backend generates a JWT.

The frontend sends the token with protected API requests:

Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>

The backend validates the JWT through the security filter.

Role-Based Access Control

The platform supports multiple roles:

CUSTOMER
VENDOR
ADMIN
WAREHOUSE STAFF

Different roles have access to different platform capabilities.

Example:

CUSTOMER
 ├── Browse products
 ├── Cart
 ├── Checkout
 ├── Orders
 └── Returns

VENDOR
 ├── Product management
 ├── Inventory
 ├── Vendor orders
 ├── Coupons
 └── Commission information

ADMIN
 ├── Dashboard
 ├── Vendors
 ├── Orders
 ├── Coupons
 ├── Commissions
 ├── Returns
 └── Warehouses

WAREHOUSE STAFF

   │
   ▼
CONFIRMED
   │
   ▼
PROCESSING
   │
   ▼
SHIPPED
   │
   ▼
OUT_FOR_DELIVERY
   │
   ▼

Orders can also be cancelled where permitted by the order state.

The backend maintains:

Order information
Order items
Product information
Vendor information
Payment information
Coupon information
Order status
Total amount
Order date
🔄 Returns Management

ShopStack supports customer return requests and administrative return processing.

Return functionality includes:

Customer return request
Return status
Return condition
Return inspection
Admin return management
Return action processing

The system separates the customer request from administrative processing.

💰 Vendor Commission Management

ShopStack includes a vendor commission system.

When eligible orders are processed, commissions can be calculated based on the configured commission rate.

Commission records contain information such as:

Order
Vendor
Sale amount
Commission rate
Commission amount
Vendor amount
Commission status
Creation date

The platform also provides administrative commission management.

🔔 Notifications

ShopStack provides notification functionality for relevant platform events.

For example, when a customer places an order containing products from a vendor, the corresponding vendor can receive an order notification.

Notification information includes:

Recipient
Order
Message
Read/unread status
Creation timestamp
⚠️ Error Handling

The application includes frontend and backend error handling for common scenarios.

Examples include:

Invalid login
Invalid registration data
Invalid form inputs
API failures
Server errors
Payment failures
Insufficient stock
Invalid coupons
Expired coupons
Unauthorized access
Order errors
Return errors
Refund-related errors

The frontend uses centralized error-handling utilities to provide user-friendly messages instead of exposing backend stack traces directly to users.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Install the following before running the project:

Java 21
Node.js
npm
PostgreSQL
Git
Maven (optional because Maven Wrapper is included)
Docker (optional)
🔧 Backend Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd Enterprise-level-e-commerce-website-

Navigate to the backend:

cd .

The backend is a Spring Boot application managed using Maven.

Run using Maven Wrapper:

Windows
mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
Linux / macOS
./mvnw spring-boot:run

The backend runs on:

http://localhost:8080
🎨 Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend:

cd frontend

Install dependencies:

npm install

Start the development server:

npm run dev

The frontend will normally be available at:

http://localhost:5173
🗄️ PostgreSQL Configuration

Create a PostgreSQL database for ShopStack.

Configure the database connection in:

src/main/resources/application.properties

Example structure:

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/shopstack
spring.datasource.username=<your-username>
spring.datasource.password=<your-password>

Do not commit real passwords or production secrets to GitHub.

For production environments, use environment variables or a secure secrets-management solution.

🐳 Docker Setup

ShopStack includes Docker configuration for containerized deployment.

Build and start the application using:

docker compose up --build

To run containers in detached mode:

docker compose up -d --build

To stop the containers:

docker compose down

To view running containers:

docker ps
🔑 Environment Variables & Secrets

The following types of information should be treated as secrets:

PostgreSQL passwords
JWT secrets
Razorpay API keys
Razorpay secret keys
Email credentials
Cloud credentials
Production API credentials

Never commit production credentials directly into:

application.properties
.env
source code
Git history

Use environment variables for sensitive configuration.

Example:
